- **Candu API Key:** Candu requires an API key to send data to Candu.

### Candu setup

2. Navigate to the **Credentials** tab to find and copy your account's API Key.

### Amplitude setup

1. In Amplitude, navigate to **Data Destinations**, then find **Candu - Event Stream**.
2. Enter a sync name, then click **Create Sync**.
3. Toggle Status from **Disabled** to **Enabled**.
4. Paste your **API Key (Access Token from the Candu platform)**.
5. (Optional) In the **Create & Update users** section, enable the toggle if you want to send users and their properties in real-time whenever Amplitude creates a user or updates the user property.
