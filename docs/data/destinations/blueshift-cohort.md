### Use cases

Sending cohorts from Amplitude to Blueshift can enable brands to leverage the power of Blueshift's AI technology and omnichannel capabilities to enhance customer engagement and deliver personalized experiences. Here are some use cases for sending cohorts from Amplitude to Blueshift:

1. **Behavior-Based Personalization:** Brands can create cohorts in Amplitude based on user behavior, such as product usage patterns, feature adoption, or content consumption. These cohorts can be sent to Blueshift to trigger 1:1 personalized messaging and offers to users who exhibit specific behaviors. For example, if a cohort shows that users have abandoned their shopping carts, Blueshift can send automated cart abandonment emails with 1:1 personalized product recommendations.
2. **Onboarding and Activation:** Brands can identify cohorts of new users who have signed up but haven't completed onboarding or activation steps. These cohorts can be sent to Blueshift to trigger personalized onboarding journeys, welcome emails, or in-app messages to guide users through the activation process and improve retention.
3. **Segmented Campaigns:** Brands can segment their user base in Amplitude based on various attributes, such as demographics, location, or engagement history. These segments can be sent to Blueshift for targeted marketing campaigns. For instance, sending a cohort of high-value customers to Blueshift for a VIP campaign with exclusive offers and content.
